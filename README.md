# 15-Day Deep Dive Plan: Networking & Security Foundations for Cloud System Design

This is a structured **15-day roadmap** to learn and document fundamentals of **networking, security, and cloud system design**, while building towards a single advanced blog project:  
**Designing a Secure Global File Sharing System on Cloud.**

---

## üìÖ Plan Overview
- **Phase 1 (Days 1‚Äì5):** Networking Foundations  
- **Phase 2 (Days 6‚Äì10):** Security Deep Dive  
- **Phase 3 (Days 11‚Äì15):** Cloud Infra, DevOps, and Resilience  

Each day:  
1. **Study** ‚Üí Core topic (theory + references)  
2. **Practice** ‚Üí Hands-on (tools, cloud, labs)  
3. **Draft** ‚Üí Add notes/diagrams to final blog

## üóìÔ∏è Daily Breakdown

### **Phase 1 ‚Äì Networking Core (Day 1‚Äì5)**
- **Day 1:** DNS & GeoDNS (dig, nslookup, tracing resolution)  
- **Day 2:** TLS Handshake & Certificates (Wireshark + OpenSSL demo)  
- **Day 3:** Load Balancing (L4 vs L7, Nginx demo)  
- **Day 4:** CDN & HTTP3/QUIC (curl header inspection)  
- **Day 5:** End-to-End Packet Flow (trace file upload in Wireshark)  

---

### **Phase 2 ‚Äì Security Deep Dive (Day 6‚Äì10)**
- **Day 6:** Authentication (OAuth2, OIDC, JWT)  
- **Day 7:** Authorization (RBAC, IAM least privilege)  
- **Day 8:** Encryption (KMS, TLS 1.3, GPG hands-on)  
- **Day 9:** Network Security (VPC design, SG, NACL, zero trust)  
- **Day 10:** Compliance & Logging (CloudTrail, SIEM, GDPR basics)  

---

### **Phase 3 ‚Äì Cloud Infra & DevOps Angle (Day 11‚Äì15)**
- **Day 11:** Object Storage Internals (S3 consistency, versioning)  
- **Day 12:** Multi-Region Deployment (active-active vs passive, Route53 failover)  
- **Day 13:** Observability & Resilience (rate limiting, tracing with Jaeger)  
- **Day 14:** DevSecOps Automation (Terraform + CI/CD + tfsec/trivy)  
- **Day 15:** CAP Theorem & Trade-offs (consistency vs availability, cost vs security)  

---

## ‚úÖ Final Deliverable
At the end of 15 days, you will have:  
- A **deep understanding** of networking & security fundamentals in cloud context.  
- A **comprehensive blog**: *‚ÄúDesigning a Secure Global File Sharing System on Cloud‚Äù*.  
- Hands-on demos, notes, and diagrams to back your learning.
